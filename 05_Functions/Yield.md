Great question! The difference between `yield` and `return` is **very important** when you're working with **functions vs generators** in Python. Let's break it down in a clear and simple way:

---

### 🔁 `return` — Exits the function and gives a result

- `return` sends a **value back** and **ends the function completely**.
- Once you hit `return`, the function stops.

#### Example:

```python
def my_function():
    return 5
    print("This won't run")  # Unreachable

print(my_function())  # Output: 5
```

---

### 🔄 `yield` — Pauses the function and gives a value

- `yield` is used in **generators**.
- It **returns a value**, but instead of ending the function, it **pauses** it.
- The function can **resume where it left off** the next time it's called.

#### Example:

```python
def my_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

gen = my_generator()
print(next(gen))  # 1
print(next(gen))  # 2
print(next(gen))  # 3
```

So `yield` lets you **return multiple values over time**, one at a time.

### ✅ Key Differences

| Feature         | `return`                        | `yield`                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Used in         | Normal functions                | Generator functions                      |
| Stops function? | Yes, ends immediately           | No, pauses and resumes later             |
| Returns         | A single value or None          | An iterator that can produce many values |
| Memory usage    | Uses more (stores all data)     | Efficient (generates values on the fly)  |

### 🧪 Real-World Example: `return` vs `yield`

```python
# Using return
def get_numbers():
    return [1, 2, 3]

# Using yield
def generate_numbers():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

# return
print(get_numbers())  # [1, 2, 3]

# yield
for num in generate_numbers():
    print(num)  # 1, 2, 3 (one by one)
```
